# Motivation

My motivation to build this game comes from my love of football,
more precisely the technology some clubs have been using to gain
an edge on their opponents. The Footbonaut is one of these
technologies that was brought in about 8 years ago and I feel
is a very evoled version of Whack-A-Mole. From such a simple
to play game came this idea which can help recovery from injuries
to ball control and passing abilities of the player. The term
Whack-A-Mole is also very topical at the moment as it is the name
of a strategy to tackle local coronavirus cases in the UK.
