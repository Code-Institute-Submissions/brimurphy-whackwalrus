# Whack A Walrus

[View live project here](https://brimurphy.github.io/whackwalrus/)

Whack a Walrus is based on the old Whack-A-Mole arcade game.
It's designed to be fun and easy to play for all ages.

_This game is for educational purposes as part of my **Interactive Frontend Project**_

# Motivation

My motivation to build this game comes from my love of football,
more precisely the technology some clubs have been using to gain
an edge on their opponents. The Footbonaut is one of these
technologies that was brought in about 8 years ago and I feel
is a very evoled version of Whack-A-Mole. From such a simple
to play game came this idea which can help recovery from injuries
to ball control and passing abilities of the player. The term
Whack-A-Mole is also very topical at the moment as it is the name
of a strategy to tackle local coronavirus cases in the UK.

### Target audience

The target audience is from 7 years old up to anyone looking
to kill a few moments in their otherwise busy day. 

## UX

### User Stories

- As a first time user I want to easily understand how to play the game.

- As a user I want simple game play.

- As a user I want to view the Highscores.

- As a user I want to have fun.

- As a user I want smooth game play.

### Design 

- Colour Scheme
  - ![Color Palette](assets/images/readme-imgs/color-palette.png)

    I have used Color Palette #3652 from [Color Palettes](https://colorpalettes.net/color-palette-3652/)
    named Colors of Ice. I taught these colours really complimented the colours found
    in the colder climates of the games characters, the walrus and penguin.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
- Typography
  
  - For the typography I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
    I've used the Londrina Solid and Shadow font for the headers,
    Amatic SC for the time, score and leaderboard text and
    Carter One for the story on the start game screen.
    These three styles really worked with the cartoonish graphics I had 
    decided to go with for the game.

- Graphics 

  - I decided to go with a cartoony look for the game, this was to ensure younger
    players could enjoy the game as much as older players.

         I edited the grey to the black colour on the penguin to tie it in better.

### Features

- This game is designed to be played on Desktop, Tablet and Mobile devices

When the game is loaded you are greeted by the welcome screen, which gives you two
options 1. To start the game and 2. to view the leaderboard of high scores

![Welcome Screen](assets/images/readme-imgs/start-screen.png)

The leaderboard screen holds the names and scores of the 5 highest ranking players
and a back button to return to the previous page.

![Leaderboard](assets/images/readme-imgs/leaderboard-screen.png)

When the game is started the 20 second countdown begins and walruuses will pop up
at different snow clouds, if you can hit(click on) a walrus 1 point will be added to 
your score. The game ends after 20 seconds and you are returned to the Welcome screen.

![Game Screen](assets/images/readme-imgs/game-screen.png)

On Mobile and Tablets the game screen will be different, this was to help solve positioning issues on multiple
screen sizes. When a walrus is hit a 'Whack' sound is played to confirm the hit and the score should increase by one.

### Future Features

-  Different playing backgrounds

-  Animations on reaching highscore

-  Add objects to avoid whacking to increase difficulty

### Wireframes

I have used Balsamiq to create my wireframes for this project, 
they originally started as some very poor free hand drawings.
You can see the wireframes below:
